# Random-Password-Generator

It was one of the first projects I developed while learning more about JavaScript, and that's why I implemented vanilla JavaScript.

  - The user can specify the length of his password.
  - The user can choose whether they want numbers or symbols in their password.
  - When you press a button, a randomly generated password will appear, both of which are unique.
  - Depending on which password is selected, the Copy button copies it to the clipboard.

It was a lot of fun building this mini-project, and I'm sure I'll come up with a better way to improve it. But if anyone has a better and more entertaining idea, please let me know.
