# Random-Password-Generator

It was one of the first projects I developed while learning more about JavaScript, and that's why I implemented vanilla JavaScript.

  - The user can decide on his preferred length for the password
  - The password will generate letters, symbols and numbers
  - On each button pressed generated random password will show, both different from each other.

It was fun building this mini-project, and for sure will think of a more suitable implementation to enhance it. I left some concepts commented on the code, but if anyone has something better and more fun, please do tell I would love the suggestion.
